# Dictionary_CLI
Small Dictionary application build on Python CLI

This program is for beginners who are learning python and trying to understand if and for loop in the programming language.
We have used two libraries which is already installed with python.

1. json - for loading our data.json file
2. difflib - from difflib we imported get_close_matches to suggest user about word they are looking for.

Note:It is a small dicitonary might not contain all the words.

Happy coding!
